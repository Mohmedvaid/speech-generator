Hey there. Can’t sleep either? You’re in the right place. Tonight’s trip is a bit rough around the edges, though. We’re heading somewhere cold, smoky, and very, very smelly. Ever wonder what your lungs would think if they inhaled coal dust, horse dung, and boiling cabbage before breakfast? Let’s just say: it’s not exactly spa day. If that sounds like your kind of weird, hit like, subscribe if you’re vibing, and drop a comment telling us where you're listening from—and what time the clock says on your end.
So: dim the lights. Let the fan hum or the rain app drip. Snuggle deeper into that blanket. Because the moment you open your eyes… you’re not in your bedroom anymore. Congratulations—you’ve just woken up in the year of our soot-covered Lord, eighteen seventy-two. And someone just emptied a chamber pot into the street right outside your face.
